## 1. Basic Functionality Test

**Objective**: Ensure that Pipex correctly handles simple commands and file redirections.

**Test Case**:

```bash
./pipex infile.txt "grep 'pattern'" "wc -l" outfile.txt
```

**Expected Behavior**:

- The content of `infile.txt` is passed to `grep 'pattern'`.
- The output of the `grep` command is then passed to `wc -l`.
- The final result (number of lines containing 'pattern') is written to `outfile.txt`.

**Verification**:

- Compare the content of `outfile.txt` with the expected result.
- Ensure no errors are reported during execution.

## 2. Handling Non-Existent Input File

**Objective**: Verify that Pipex gracefully handles cases where the input file does not exist.

**Test Case**:

```bash
./pipex non_existent_file.txt "ls -l" "wc -l" output.txt
```

**Expected Behavior**:

- Pipex should display an error message indicating that the input file cannot be found or opened.
- `output.txt` should not be created or should be empty.

**Verification**:

- Check for the appropriate error message.
- Ensure `output.txt` is not created or remains empty.

## 3. Command Not Found

**Objective**: Test Pipex's response when a specified command is invalid or not found.

**Test Case**:

```bash
./pipex infile.txt "invalid_command" "wc -l" output.txt
```

**Expected Behavior**:

- Pipex should display an error message indicating that `invalid_command` is not found.
- The program should handle the error gracefully without crashing.

**Verification**:

- Observe the error message for clarity and accuracy.
- Ensure the program exits gracefully.

## 4. Permission Denied on Output File

**Objective**: Check how Pipex handles situations where it lacks write permissions to the output file.

**Test Case**:

```bash
touch restricted_output.txt
chmod 444 restricted_output.txt  # Read-only permissions
./pipex infile.txt "ls -l" "wc -l" restricted_output.txt
```

**Expected Behavior**:

- Pipex should display an error message indicating that it cannot write to `restricted_output.txt` due to insufficient permissions.

**Verification**:

- Confirm the presence of the appropriate error message.
- Ensure no unintended modifications to `restricted_output.txt`.

## 5. Multiple Commands (Bonus)

**Objective**: Verify that Pipex can handle multiple commands in a pipeline, if implemented.

**Test Case**:

```bash
./pipex infile.txt "grep 'pattern'" "sort" "uniq -c" "sort -nr" outfile.txt
```

**Expected Behavior**:

- The content of `infile.txt` is processed through the series of commands.
- The final sorted and counted result is written to `outfile.txt`.

**Verification**:

- Compare `outfile.txt` with the expected output.
- Ensure the pipeline processes data correctly through all stages.

## 6. Here Document (Bonus)

**Objective**: Test the here-document functionality, if implemented.

**Test Case**:

```bash
./pipex here_doc END "cat" "wc -l" outfile.txt
```

**During Execution**:

- Provide input until typing `END` on a new line.

**Expected Behavior**:

- Pipex reads the input until `END` is encountered.
- The input is processed by `cat` and then `wc -l`.
- The line count is written to `outfile.txt`.

**Verification**:

- Ensure `outfile.txt` contains the correct line count based on the provided input.

## Automated Testing Resources

To streamline testing, consider using existing Pipex testers developed by the 42 community:

- **pipexMedic**: A comprehensive C tester for Pipex that checks output files, standard streams, exit codes, and file permissions. citeturn0search0

- **pipex_tester_42**: A shell-based tester that verifies the functionality of your Pipex program across various scenarios. citeturn0search1

**Usage**:

1. Clone the desired tester repository into your Pipex project directory.

2. Navigate to the tester directory.

3. Run the test script with the appropriate mode (e.g., mandatory, bonus).

**Example**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmarcha/pipexMedic.git
cd pipexMedic
bash test.sh basic
```

**Note**: These testers are designed to run on a Linux environment. Ensure compatibility with your development setup.

## Conclusion

Thorough testing is crucial to ensure your Pipex implementation functions correctly under various conditions. By designing comprehensive test cases and utilizing available testing tools, you can validate the robustness and reliability of your program. Remember to handle errors gracefully and provide clear messages to enhance user experience.
